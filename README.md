**README**

This started off as a TDD, Ruby version of an [Objective-C command line game](http://github.com/hamchapman/makerword) I made. When I'd written the main logic up in Ruby code I decided that I'd like to make it into a fully-fledged site.

However, I've not yet had time to do so. It is something that I'll be returning to soon to finish off because I've never properly coded a game before and would like to try it.
